## CLWP - What's in a name?

### THE PROBLEM

The problem was simple, **we were the bottleneck**.

Maintaining a portfolio of sites both built and bought over the course of a decade was weighing down on productivity.

Responsible for `300+ Million` sessions each year, we were immensely proud of our work, we often found ourselves stuck between a rock and a hard place as the maitenence footprint kept growing despite our best efforts to stay organized.

While their overall strategies were quite similar, each site existed in their own vacuum; all with their own little unique twists and takes on tables, product cards, top 5 lists and all of the the `Click Thru Rate` optimized components the site teams could come up with.

Times were good and times were bad: All of our flagship sites were ranking strongly, iterating quickly, and failing fast. The `"tech-debt"` was piling up.

    - Site A testing a table redesign
    - Site B fixed a mobile render bug in the text
    - Site C just built scrolling hero cards
    - Huge opportunity to add Strutured Data Markup to all pages/components
    - Aqcuired Site K, lets get component 8 from Site E, component 3 from Site F
    - Site B wants the new table design styled to their site
    - Sites A, C-J need to bring in the bug fix from Site B
    - ...
    - ...

These problems grew exponentially and were getting near impossible to prioritize.

### Solution: Enter CLWP

#### The Brass Tax

    - The flagship sites were built on a glorified router of a CMS (in the LAMP Stack) with a WordPress blog reverse proxied into a subfolder.
    - Our aquired sites were custom WordPress themes
    - Our potential acquisitions were all custom WordPress themes
    - Team consisted of primarily Jr. level front-end developers

#### The Plan

> Centralize all of the components, THEN theme them.

    - Grab the best converting/performant version of all these components
        - Optimize schema and SEO opportunities with SEO
        - Normalize against a design system with Design team
        - Implement a holistic click tracking
    - Due dilligence on WordPress based page builders vs building on from scratch (selected: Elementor)
        - Future thinking: must save page data as JSON for future Headless WordPress
    - Generate component schema, options, and variants
    - Build a scraper/migration tool to transpile our existing sites and future acquisitions

#### The Outcome

> It takes a long time to turn a big ship

Over the course of two years we migrated 9 sites and deployed 4 new ones

###### Productivity Gains

We are no longer the bottleneck!

- 80% reduction in time spent on design related tickets
- Content time-to-market 10x
- Bug fixes happen once, deployed portfolio-wide

#### Site Performance Gains
